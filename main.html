         <p id="maintext"><strong>I am a freelance editor and assistant, based in London. I’ve worked on a 
               range of projects, including short and feature length independent films, 
			   documentaries, and corporate and promotional videos.<br>
			   I am Avid and Final Cut Pro certified (Manhattan Edit Workshop), and have also 
			   work extensively with Adobe Premiere Pro. I have recently been working on a variety 
			   of freelance projects, while completing my Masters Degree in Post-Production (Met Film School,
			   London).<br>
			   <br>
			   I also have a BA from The National University of Theatre and Film “I.L. Caragiale” in Bucharest,
			   Romania specialising in editing. During this time, I interned at TVR 1 
			   (Romanian Public Television) where I worked as an editorial assistant, 
			   in addition to editing short interviews. I also assisted at PRO TV 
			   (Romanian Private TV Channel) where I edited film trailers.<br>
			   <br>
			   I'm eager to further develop my knowledge and understanding of post-production processes 
			   and workflows, and would very much appreciate the oportunity to work within a 
			   professional company. I think that my knowledge and experience would lend perfectly to a 
			   junior role, and feel I could work very eectively as an assistant, runner or trainee.<br>

				<br>
				<br>
         		I am driven, dedicated and creative. I have excellent organisational and interpersonal skills, as well as a
				demonstrated ability to meet defined deadlines and objectives.<br>
				I have a broad knowledge of the filmmaking process from inception to completion. I can provide effecient administrative 
				support for a wide variety of departments. I am able to assist and support collegues and team members. I have a solid 
				understanding of post-production processes and software. I am technologically proficient and quick to learn.
